    "Next we need to code the actual training loop. This loop will run through the training data for a set number of epochs. In each epoch, it should iterate through all of the training examples. Ideally, it will do this in a random order every time. You should run the example through the model, calculate the loss, and then use the loss to run the backward step. **be sure to zero out the gradients before calling the forward step!!** This is done with `ffnn.zero_grad()` Our loss function is stored in the FFNN object, and can be called using `ffnn.loss()`. The backpropagation step is run on the loss, i.e. `loss.backward()` (where `loss` is the loss computed at this time step). At the end of each epoch, the"

You could change the model itself, adding more layers or trying a different activation function. You could add dropout after one of the layers (this takes one line to implement with pytorch, but you might have to look up about what it is or how it's used). You can also add hand-crafted features in addition to the embeddings to serve as input. This is a very common strategy and usually helps a lot."
